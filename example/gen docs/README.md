# A Quick Example

I used `codegpt gen docs` on the generate.py file, and the main.py file. Results are here, raw.

For the prompt I said `How do you use the docs command?` for generate.py, and `Write me a README.md, explain what you can figure out, don't worry about the imported stuff.` for main.py. It did pretty good!
