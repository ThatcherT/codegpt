# Code Review: codegpt/gpt_interface.py

## Summary

This code is part of a codegpt library and is a module for interacting with GPT-3. It contains functions for sending prompts to the GPT-3 engine, confirming whether a prompt should be sent, and parsing the response from the engine. It also includes code for downloading the NLTK punkt tokenizer if it is not already available.

## Classes and Functions

- `confirm_send(prompt: str, max_tokens: int = 4000, yes: bool = False, silent: bool = False) -> int`: This function checks the length of the prompt and confirms that the user wants to send it to the GPT-3 engine. It returns the maximum number of tokens the engine can return in response.

- `send_iffy_edit(prompt: str, code: Dict[str, str], clipboard: bool = False, yes: bool = False) -> Dict[str, str]:` This function is used to send a prompt with code that may need to be edited. It returns a parsed response from the GPT-3 engine.

- `send_normal_completion(prompt: str, max_tokens: int = 3000, yes: bool = False) -> str:` This function is used to send a normal prompt to the GPT-3 engine. It returns the response from the engine.

## External Dependencies

- `nltk`: Used for downloading the punkt tokenizer.
- `openai`: Used for interacting with the GPT-3 engine.
- `typer`: Used for printing colored text and prompting the user for confirmation.
- `textwrap`: Used for dedenting strings.
- `codegpt.parse`: Used for parsing the response from the GPT-3 engine.
